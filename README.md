# SafetyNet

## Project 3: Python and Data Centric Development

### Context
In the all industries, safety is paramount in making sure that the employees can work with a peace of mind and operations can run smoothly. This is especially crucial in heavy industries where the nature of the jobs are dangerous and no safety plan can completely eliminates all risk. Hence, having a strong reporting culture will educate and inform employees to do their work in a safe manner. 

This reports are not only meant for accidents which is defined as unexpected and undesirable event, especially one resulting in damage or harm. Near miss, defined as an unplanned event that has the potential to cause, but does not actually result in injuryn or damage, and violation, defined as an action that breaks or acts against something, especially a law.

However, most reports are done via Microsoft word or excel document and this makes it inefficient to extract and retrieve data.

SafetyNet is meant for employees working in a company to upload safety reports that they see in their workplace. With SafetyNet, these reports can be directly be uploaded direct to the company database. All personnel can read the reports on the various safety issues and but only those registered can edit or delete their reports. This will empower employees to take action in reporting and be responisble for their own safety.
